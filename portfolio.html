    <h1>This is a clicker game where the burger moves back and forth in a
	    circular motion. The goal is to use your mouse to click on the
	    burger as many times as you can in 10 seconds. The borders
	    are red and yellow to represent ketchup and mustard to go with
	    the burger theme. There is also a countdown timer to let you know
	    how much time you have left.<h1>

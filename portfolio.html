<h1>Burger Clicker Game Project</h1>
<img src="burgerclickergame.png" height="350">
<h1>This is a clicker game where the burger moves back and forth in a
    circular motion. The goal is to use your mouse to click on the
    burger as many times as you can in 10 seconds. The borders
    are red and yellow to represent ketchup and mustard to go with
    the burger theme. There is also a countdown timer to let you know
    how much time you have left.<h1>

<h1>Basketball Dropper Game Project</h1>

<h1>This is a basketball dropper game. When the game starts, a basketball 
    with a random number will appear. You have to press the number 
    on the keyboard to drop the basketball. When it is dropped, 
    a point is added to the counter. There is a 20 second timer.<h1>

<h1>This game is a ping pong inspired game. The green paddle follows the movement 
    of the computer mouse. When a starfish collides with the paddle, the starfish 
    will change color and bounce off. The starfish will bounce off the walls as well. 
    Everytime a starfish touches the paddle, a point is added to the scoreboard. 
    The game also keeps track of your high score. When a starfish touches the red 
    end line on the bottom of the screen, the game will end.<h1>

<h1>After comparing the graphs from the rover data and the sketched graphs, the rover is 
	most likely located in the Rocky Mountains biome. When comparing the graphs side by 
	side, you can match the correct graph with the correct sketched graph for light 
	(graph 1), sound (graph 2), wind (graph 3), and temperature (graph 4). This is because 
	you can see tendencies and trends in both graphs which make them similar.<h1>
